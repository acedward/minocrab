//! THE OUTBOX, AS A CONTRACT — `Outbox<Filing, Env, WORDS>` (M41 B/C,
//! notes/stream-design.org, "emit restored"): the contention-free replacement
//! of M39's `Queued` batch, and the reference PRIMITIVE stream.
//!
//! What this file is the witness for:
//!
//! 1. A request that CHOOSES NO NONCE AND NO FEE, and READS NO SHARED
//!    STATE. `call` takes the callee, the arguments and the key version; the
//!    nonce is assigned by a blind `add` on the accumulator and snapshotted
//!    into the handle's entry, never read by the circuit.
//! 2. `emit`, one request per transaction, permissionless: two stable reads
//!    of the handle's entries, then exactly what `Pending::request` files —
//!    one record, one id, one notification.
//! 3. The settle side is `Pending`'s, followed by the spec's C3 check and a
//!    blind max on last seen.
//! 4. THE CONTENTION AUDIT (the milestone's gate): across the three
//!    circuits, no `popeq` reads either accumulator cell — checked on the
//!    emitted Impact stream, not on prose. The one shared read that remains
//!    is the Signet REQUEST nonce inside `file_request`, the protocol
//!    record's counter (notes/nonce-admin.org §10.1), counted here so its
//!    presence is a number and not a surprise.
//!
//! IT IS A TEST-ONLY CONTRACT, like `tests/evm_no_return.rs`'s: it exercises
//! the API without adding circuits to the crate's frozen snapshots.
